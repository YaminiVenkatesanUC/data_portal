API Notes:

When removing indicator fomr data defintions the visualization for that indicator will still work in the app becuase it is not being pulled from the API.
Question: Do we want to remove indicator from DATA_STORE once visualised by API?

All configuration updates should be done in config/covid_19_odata and config/covid_19_data. How should we control when these two configs become out of sync? Developers will have to remember to update the indicator names of both. (i.e. class, indicator_name, type)

Question: How to handel when the API is using a different name than the source? config/covid_19_odata contains a name to be kept track in the portal and a seprate name that can be the same or different from teh API.

To do: configs need to be indexed by name rather than numerically. Currently we dont know which indicator in the list is which.

Need to double check that col values are labeled sequentially

Check that resources are only in metadata once

Adding check for paging

passing all definitions to load functions - modfiy to pass only single definitions

how to combine all dataframes to then be pushed to the API

is multiplier really 0?

to turn off API comment out load of configuration file
