A positive reading means that many of the underlying input indicators are growing at above-average rates, and vice versa for a negative reading. All RAI components are presented in terms of annual percentage changes, standardised to have mean = 0 and standard deviation = 1. As the benefit system has changed over time, the MSD jobseekers data contains modelled estimates of the number of claimants that would have been eligible under the current benefit system pre-2013. We reverse the sign of the RAI component for Jobseeker growth, so that these deviations move in the same direction as other economic variables (i.e. dips in a contraction). Consumer card spend is based on Paymark card expenditure. Electricity grid demand is sourced from the Electricity Authority's reconciled demand series. It has been allocated to each region using a concordance developed by Stats NZ.",
